          I'm a highly passionate and self-motivated developer, driven to craft
          creative and impactful web solutions. I take pride in being a quick

          During my graduation, I faced misdirection and battled health issues
          that tested my resolve. These struggles taught me resilience,
          discipline, and the power of focus. I transformed setbacks into
          opportunities to grow, sharpening my skills through self-learning and
          hard work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="mt-4 text-xl">
          Now, I am more determined than ever to bring creativity, teamwork, and
          dedication to every project I work on. My journey has shaped me into
          the adaptable, solution-driven developer I am todayâ€”ready to make a
          meaningful impact through technology.
